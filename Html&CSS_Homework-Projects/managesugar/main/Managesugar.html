        <p>While it is important to have naturally occurring sugars in your diet, many foods contain harmful added sugars that contain no<br>
            nutritional value. According to a study conducted by the University of Florida, the brain releases heroin-like chemicals called<br>
            endogenous opioids when an individual indulges on sweet, salty or fatty foods.
